<h2>dockerBuildPublish step</h2>
<p>
Provides a custom step to build and push a Docker image to Docker Hub based on a Dockerfile in a branch of a GitHub Organziation Folder Pipeline project. 

Optionally, you may provide a `dockerBuildPublish.properties` file with the following configuration that will override defaults:
	<ul>
		<li><pre>org</pre> Will override use of GitHub Organization/User as Docker org/user for image name.</li>
		<li><pre>repo</pre> Will override use of GitHub Repository as for Docker image name.</li>
		<li><pre>tag</pre> Will override use of branch name as tag.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>dockerHubCredentialsId</dt>
	<dd><b>REQUIRED</b> Jenkins Credentials ID for DockerHub credentials with permissions to push to deisgnate Docker Hub Org/Account</dd>
	<dt>tagAsLatest</dt>
	<dd><b>OPTIONAL</b> allows overriding auto tagging and pushing of built image as latest - for example: <pre>false</pre> - defaults to <pre>true</pre></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>The following example would result in a Docker image with the name and tag of 'beedemo/mobile-deposit-api:1.1' being built and pushed.</p>
<pre>
	dockerBuildPublish {
		dockerHubCredentialsId = 'beedemo-docker-hub-credentials'
		tagAsLatest = false
	}
</pre>
